## **How It Works**
- QuizMaster is built using Object-Oriented Programming principles and consists of the following components:

- Question Model (question_model.py): Defines the Question class, which stores a quiz question and its answer.

- Data (data.py): Contains a set of quiz questions, each with a category, type, difficulty, question, and correct/incorrect answers.

- Quiz Brain (quiz_brain.py): Manages the quiz session, keeps track of the score, and handles user interactions.

- Main Program (main.py): The heart of the application, where questions are loaded, the quiz is played, and the final score is displayed.
